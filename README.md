# Unikernel-with-region-inference
Bachelor thesis in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen.

## Introduction

## Simple example
Here is a small example of a Unikernel service. The port `8080` is bound to a callback function which
here is the identity function i.e. an echo service. It then listens for any incomming messages.
```ml
open Network

val _ = (
    bindUDP 8080 (fn data => data);
    listen ()
)
```
Logging can be turned on with the `logOn()` function and the service will print and log useful information
as seen below.
```sh
==== FROM: 74 212 82 133 150 162 ====

Destination mac-address: [ 123 124 125 126 127 128 ]

```

### Further examples
The project include four small examples (these run on both Unix and Xen - see below):
* Echo: a simple echo server that mirrors exactly what it receives
* Facfib: serves two ports with the factorial and fibonacci functions respectively
* MonteCarlo: estimates pi using the [sml-sobol library](https://github.com/diku-dk/sml-sobol) (run `smlpkg sync` before use). 
* Sort: sorts its given integers using mergesort

## Sending data to the unikernel
Once the unikernel is running one can send UDP packets to the unikernel via netcat: <br />
```sh 
$ echo -n “Hello, World!” | nc -u -nw1 127.0.0.2 8080
```

## Compilation and running a unikernel
In order for the network to be initialized run: <br />
```sh
$ make setup
```

### UNIX
The `make` rule for compiling an application defaults to UNIX and is used with: <br />
```sh
$ make <application name>-app
```

Run the application as an executable:
```sh
$ ./<application name>.exe
```

### XEN
In order to compile an application to Xen the target must be specified: <br />
```sh
$ make t=xen <application name>-app
```

## Creating your own application
To create an application create a new directory and include two files:
* `main.sml` which contains the code for the application 
* `main.mlb` which is the ML basis file containing the applications dependencies

## Monitor network interface (tap0)
`$ sudo tshark -i tap0`
